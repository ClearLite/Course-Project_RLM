This program allows users to schedule a mobile car detailing service by selecting a service, choosing a date, and setting an appointment time. It ensures valid input for service selection and appointment time. After the user provides their details, the program displays the order summary on-screen and saves it to a text file `(order_summary.txt)`. The program uses inheritance, file handling, arrays, loops, and encapsulation to manage the ordering process efficiently.
